# Text-Editor

## Description

To be completely honest, this challenge seems more boiler plate provided so I used this challenge as a way to learn more about PWA's and the logic behind building them. It seems that 
the PWA week is more targeted to give information on webpack before moving to React which uses it under the hood. I learned more about the PWA logic, and trying to focus
on the reactivity of the application. The lighthouse application was a great tool to learn about and could be used to demostrate how you can improve websites for companies.
